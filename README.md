How to Play?
You have 90 seconds to fish up all the fish to gain points!
Either press the Space key on your keyboard, or click using your Left Mouse Button (LMB).
You MUST reel the fish, thus you will have to mash your buttons to catch the fish.
Fishes range between levels 1 - 10. Differing in points that they’ll give, as well as how much do you have to work to catch them!
The top 10 scores will be saved in the leaderboards, saved locally!
Penalties
To make things a bit more challenging, penalties will take place. Having a penalty will reduce the timer by 5 seconds, making you lose more time to reel in the fish!

Penalties are applied if:
You’ve managed to hook the fish, but failed to properly catch it.
You tried to throw your fishing rod, but missed.
